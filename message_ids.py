"""Stable message ids.

A message's `seq` is its position in the chat's shown branch. It can move when
a backup is re-imported and an earlier message was edited or regenerated (the
chat switches branches), and would move if messages could ever be edited or
deleted in the app. Each export also gives every message its own id (Claude
`uuid`, ChatGPT node `id`), which never moves; build_db stores it in
`messages.message_uuid`.

The id is the identity. Message links and bookmarks find their message by
id, and when that id is gone the message is gone: they never fall back to
whatever now sits at the old position. The position is used only for a
conversation that has no ids at all (an export without them, or an older
database whose backups are no longer in source/).

A message id is only ever looked up together with its conversation id, so
ids from different providers can never be confused with one another.
