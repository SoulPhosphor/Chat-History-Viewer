"""Reusable logic for conditional bulk labeling.

A deliberately narrow selection tool: it can only change which labels a
conversation carries (Added / Removed / Cleared). It never deletes, archives,
moves, or renames. All populated criteria are combined with AND. Batches are
deterministic — a stable id tie-breaker is always appended to the ordering.

As with the other API-logic modules, these functions take an open connection
(user-data DB attached as ``udb``) and return JSON-able dicts; error cases raise
``ApiError``. The caller (server.py) owns opening/closing the connection.
